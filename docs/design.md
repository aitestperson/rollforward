# Design notes

The brief asked for a look that is "mature and dependable, but at the same time fresh and appealing", without the generic AI-generated look. The page, [web/index.html](../web/index.html), follows these notes.

## What the sources say

- Generic UI is an accumulation of defaults nobody chose: an indigo or violet accent, Inter, rounded cards with soft shadows, icons in rounded squares, pills, gradients, motion everywhere, and copy that restates its label.
- Swapping one fashionable default for another doesn't fix it; the current one is cream backgrounds with serif headings. Each choice should come from the product and its users.
- Design the awkward states too: empty, missing, in progress, disabled.
- Render, screenshot, get a critique from outside, and iterate.

## Choices

- **The colours carry provenance.** Blue marks a file a person uploaded and black a file the agent made, borrowing the spreadsheet habit of blue for typed-in values and black for calculated ones. A note carries a gray triangle, like Excel's comment, because it is for information; red is kept for a question, which needs a person. The only other colour marks the two ways an instance ends: Close instance is solid blue, a person's commit, and Abandon is red, a discard.
- **Type:** IBM Plex Sans, a plain engineered face. IBM Plex Mono is used only for code and addresses: file types, cell references, paths and tool calls. Numerals are tabular everywhere.
- **Surfaces:** tiles have a 1px border and no shadow. Only floating things are raised: question cards, and Advanced when expanded. A card points at its tile, like an Excel comment. There are two radii: 4px for tiles and buttons, and 8px for cards.
- **The awkward states are drawn:**
  - a missing input, with how often closed instances had it;
  - an output not built yet;
  - a run in progress, with Close disabled until it ends;
  - what each question defaults to if it's still unanswered at close.
- **The sidebar is a cascade:** workspace, series, instance, each level indented under a rule. A row's actions sit in its corner, ⋯ for settings and + for a new child, so the list holds only things and never grows a row of buttons.
- **Copy** names objects and consequences. There is no helper text that repeats a label. A legend in the sidebar teaches the colour code once.
- **Light throughout.** A dark Advanced band looked like leftover developer scaffolding.

## Never

- Gradients, glass, glow, emoji, or sparkle and robot icons.
- Pills or badges for ordinary labels, or icons in rounded squares.
- Motion, except to show state: a spinner while the agent works, a stripe on Outputs during a run, one flash when a tile changes, and a pulsing corner on an unanswered question.
- A colour whose meaning neither the legend nor the button's label gives.

## Outside critique

Gemini 3.8 Flash reviewed the screenshots once.
- **Taken:**
  - style cell references as addresses rather than red alerts;
  - make Advanced light;
  - move the legend off the canvas;
  - anchor each card to its tile;
  - put each choice button on one line, and state the default below them.
- **Rejected, because they undo the owner's choices:**
  - tables instead of file tiles;
  - pills instead of comment triangles.
